## Juan Fumero

I am a Software Developer at Oracle, working in the Java Platform Group. 

## Background 

Prior to Oracle I was a Researcher Fellow at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) working on how to make computer programs fast by harnessing the power of specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). 
I also led the development of [TornadoVM](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM), a Java framework that automatically allows Java programs to utilize this hardware for a massive speed boost. 
My background is Just In Time compilation, managed runtime systems, GPUs and heterogeneous computing. 

## Past Collaborations 

I have worked in a few EU projects, such as [AERO European Project](https://aero-project.eu/) extending TornadoVM to enable hardware acceleration of Java programs on ARM and RISC-V based computing systems. 
Besides, I collaborated with the [GAIA project](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) (under the European Space Agency [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)) to help accelerating Java HPC workloads on GPUs using the TornadoVM software stack.
I have also worked and collaborated with Intel to bring oneAPI into the TornadoVM programming framework, in which I also performed compiler and memory optimisations for Intel compute architectures (Intel ARCs and Intel Integrated GPUs). 

## Public Speaking and Standarization

I tend to do [public speaking](https://jjfumero.github.io/talks/) about my previous research at the University of Manchester and software engineering topics. 
I have presented my work at several academic and Industry conferences, including JVMLS (2019 & 2023), QCon (2019 & 2021), Devoxx (2021), JavaZone (2021), JAX (2022), and Java User Groups, such as NYJavaSIG among many other events.

I am also an [Intel oneAPI Innovator](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/community/innovators/oneapi-all-innovators.html), 
and I participate in the [Level Zero Community Forum Hardware Group](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-tab/tree/main/hardware), 
and in the [oneAPI Language Group](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-tab/tree/main/language) to help shaping the evolution of oneAPI for managed runtime programming languages. 
From January 2025, I also participate as an external member in the [RISC-V J Extension Group](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-j-extension).

## Education 

I obtained my PhD at The University of Edinburgh on [Accelerating Interpreted Programming Languages on GPUs with Just-In-Time and Runtime Optimisations](https://jjfumero.github.io/publication/2017-08-22-PhDThesis). 
I extended the Graal JIT compiler and the Partial Evaluator to allow programmers to automatically execute Java, R and Ruby programs on GPUs via OpenCL. 

Before doing the PhD, I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science at The University of La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). 
In my Master’s project, I contributed to the development of the [accULL](https://accull.wordpress.com) compiler, the first open-source compiler’s implementation for the OpenACC standard, 
under the supervision of Dr Ruyman Reyes and Dr Francisco de Sande.

## Industry

Additionally, I have also worked as an intern at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/) and [CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/cern-openlab), 
implementing compilers and evaluating parallel programming techniques for multi-core CPU systems.
