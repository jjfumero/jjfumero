## Juan Fumero

Hi there! I am a Research Fellow working as part of the Advanced Processor Technologies [APT](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) Research Group at The University of Manchester on Heterogeneous Virtual Machines and language runtime systems for the acceleration of applications using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). I am also software architect of the [TornadoVM project](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM) (a Java framework for automatically running JVM applications on heterogeneous hardware).

Currently, I am collaborating with Intel to bring oneAPI into the TornadoVM framework to perform optimisations for Intel compute architectures (xPUs).
